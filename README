## Gerrymandering Final Project

#### Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes gerrymandering using data-driven techniques to assess political boundaries’ fairness and representation. The primary focus is to understand how electoral districts are drawn and the implications for democracy. The project involves data analysis, visualization, and exploration of potential solutions to mitigate gerrymandering effects.
