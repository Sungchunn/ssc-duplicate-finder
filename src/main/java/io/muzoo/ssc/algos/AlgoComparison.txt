Aspect: Algorithm Type
- MD5Algo: Cryptographic hash function.
- SHA256Algo: Cryptographic hash function.
- BBBAlgo: Byte-by-byte comparison (non-cryptographic).

Aspect: Hashing Method
- MD5Algo: Uses the MD5 algorithm to compute a 128-bit hash.
- SHA256Algo: Uses the SHA-256 algorithm to compute a 256-bit hash.
- BBBAlgo: Uses the file’s length and a content consistency check to generate a “hash-like” string.

Aspect: Library Used
- MD5Algo: Apache Commons Codec’s DigestUtils.md5Hex.
- SHA256Algo: Apache Commons Codec’s DigestUtils.sha256Hex.
- BBBAlgo: Apache Commons IO’s FileUtils.contentEquals for content comparison.

Aspect: Security
- MD5Algo:
  - Fast but not secure for cryptographic purposes (collision-prone).
  - Suitable for duplicate file detection.
- SHA256Algo:
  - Secure and resistant to collisions.
  - Suitable for duplicate detection and cryptographic applications.
- BBBAlgo:
  - Non-cryptographic.
  - Compares files exactly (content-based) but is slower than MD5 and SHA-256 for large files.

Aspect: Output
- MD5Algo: 128-bit hexadecimal string (32 characters).
- SHA256Algo: 256-bit hexadecimal string (64 characters).
- BBBAlgo: String in the format <file_length>-<consistency>. E.g., "1024-true" for a 1 KB file with consistent content.

Aspect: Performance
- MD5Algo:
  - Efficient for small to medium-sized files.
  - Faster than SHA-256.
- SHA256Algo:
  - Slower than MD5 due to a longer hash and additional security.
- BBBAlgo:
  - Performance depends on file size as it performs byte-by-byte comparison.
  - Slow for large files.

Aspect: Use Cases
- MD5Algo:
  - Detecting duplicates in non-critical applications.
  - Hash-based lookups.
- SHA256Algo:
  - Detecting duplicates in sensitive or security-critical applications.
  - Cryptographic verification.
- BBBAlgo:
  - Ensures exact content matching.
  - Suitable for verifying binary files where bit-for-bit comparison is required.

Aspect: Error Handling
- MD5Algo: Throws IOException if an error occurs while reading the file.
- SHA256Algo: Throws IOException if an error occurs while reading the file.
- BBBAlgo: Throws IOException if the file is null, non-existent, or unreadable.

Aspect: Efficiency on Large Files
- MD5Algo:
  - Efficient as only a hash is computed (content is not stored in memory).
  - Handles large files gracefully.
- SHA256Algo:
  - Similar efficiency as MD5.
  - Handles large files without excessive memory use.
- BBBAlgo:
  - Less efficient as it requires reading the file content twice (once for size, once for consistency check).

Aspect: Implementation Details
- MD5Algo:
  - Reads the file using FileInputStream.
  - Computes the MD5 hash using Apache Commons Codec.
- SHA256Algo:
  - Reads the file using FileInputStream.
  - Computes the SHA-256 hash using Apache Commons Codec.
- BBBAlgo:
  - Computes the file size using File.length().
  - Uses FileUtils.contentEquals for byte-by-byte content comparison.
